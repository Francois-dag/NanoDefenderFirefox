                If you are using uBlock Origin, you need to head over to my
                <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/" target="_blank">home page</a>
                to do a few more installation steps. Everything will be automatically updated for Nano Adblocker users.

                Nano Defender is <strong>100% free</strong>, and I do <strong>not</strong> accept donation.
                <strong>Now and in the future.</strong> My GitHub ID is <code>jspenguin2017</code>, my GitLab ID is
                <code>xuhaiyang1234</code>, and my domain is <code>jspenguin.com</code>. Be careful to not get scammed
                by someone who is pretending to be a developer of Nano Defender.
            </p>

            <h4>August 6, 2017</h4>
            <p>
                Since Flash player will be completely removed in 2020, websites that have anti-adblock after requesting
                Flash support are now low priority.
            </p>

            <h4 class="only-chrome">July 24, 2017</h4>
            <p class="only-chrome">
                I am aware that this page is a lot wider than it should on high DPI devices, it is caused by a bug in
                Chromium / Chrome and is fixed in Chromium / Chrome 61.
            </p>
        </div>


        <h3>Basic Troubleshooting</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Is Nano Defender up to date?</p>
            <p>Are you using another extension that may cause conflicts?</p>
            <p>Are you using another filter list that may cause conflicts?</p>
            <p>Did you change any settings that may cause your adblocker to misbehave?</p>
            <p>
                If you are using uBlock Origin, did you properly follow the
                <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/" target="_blank">extra installation steps</a>?
            </p>
            <p>
                Are you using Anti-Adblock Killer, AAK-Cont, or uBO-Extra? Nano Defender does similar things as they do
                which can lead to conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Are you using more than one adblocker? Nano Defender can only protect one adblocker and will prioritize
                Nano Adblocker.
            </p>
        </div>


        <h3>Common Questions and Problems</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Will there be a configurable whitelist for Nano Defender?</h4>
            <p class="only-chrome">
                Not until I have a reliable way to synchronously send configuration data to content scripts. This is a
                limitation of Chromium / Chrome.
            </p>
            <p class="only-firefox">
                I will think about it, but probably no since it is quite complex and when you encounter a problem, you
                should report it.
            </p>

            <h4>Can console messages be turned off?</h4>
            <p>
                No, I need to see the console output on your end to quickly find the cause of your issues, that is why
                I ask for a screenshot of the console when you open an issue.
            </p>
            <p>In production mode, all the console messages will begin with <code>[Nano]</code>, so you can easily filter them.</p>

            <h4>Nano Defender is causing (further) breakage.</h4>
            <p class="only-chrome">
                Report it and I will try to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply to breakage
                <strong>caused</strong> by Nano Defender, other breakages may not be fixed this fast.
            </p>
            <p class="only-firefox">Report it and I will have a look.</p>

            <h4>A website freezes with Nano Defender enabled.</h4>
            <p>
                Some websites will intentionally freeze (with an infinite loop for example) once they detect Nano Defender,
                it could also be caused by a bug in Nano Defender.
            </p>
            <p class="only-chrome">
                Either way, report it and I will try to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply
                to freezings <strong>caused</strong> by Nano Defender, other freezings may not be fixed this fast.
            </p>
            <p class="only-firefox">Either way, report it and I will have a look.</p>
            <p class="only-chrome">
                You can use task manager to terminate the tab that froze, go to <code>Menu -&gt; More tools -&gt; Task manager</code>,
                select the tab that froze, then click <code>End process</code>.
            </p>

            <h4>A website is still detecting my adblocker.</h4>
            <p>
                Nano Defender is not magical, a lot of websites need to be fixed on a case by case basis. Report it
                and I will have a look. Depending on the website, it can take some time.
            </p>

            <h4>A website is perceptibly slower with Nano Defender enabled.</h4>
            <p>Report it and I will have a look.</p>

            <p>
                Debug switch is in <code>common.js</code>. It may be already on when you pull the repository. Be aware that
                proprietary code loaders located in <code>content/3-content-rules-4-proprietary.js</code> may run when the
                extension is loaded in debug mode.

                Documentation of my custom API is in <code>content/content-core.js</code>, <code>content/content-domlib.js</code>,
                and <code>background/background-core.js</code>. <code>$</code> is not jQuery.
            </p>
            <p>Rules are in <code>content/3-content-rules-*.js</code> and <code>background/background-rules.js</code>.</p>
